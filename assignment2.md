# Assignment 2
In order to produce the plan composition, the students will be using the output from rhino/grasshopper into photoshop.  Minimal vector work in AutoCAD and illustrator will be 
required.

## Rhino JPEG/PNG Output
Refine your urban element in the script.  Bake it to Rhino, then export the view mode layers as separate PNGs [using print]

* be sure to save your views

* set resolution to 300dpi

Bring your layers to Photoshop and use blend modes for the layers to resolve the image and render the scene with color, depth, and line.

## Take a section
Goto food for rhino and download section tools.  The section tools plugin will provide a poshe and clipping plane for your parametric geometries rhino after they are baked from grasshopper.  The poshe can be exported with any view mode (i.e.: shaded, pen, rendered...) as a png.

## Small Multiples

The students will produce 36 drawings [6x6 grid] using the Grassopper->Rhino->Photoshop pipeline from the last lecture.  This is the chance to produce a drawing that shows the progression of your elements when sliders are changed.  There is a template file for the drawings to be draged and dropped into.

* we will be forming a 6x6 matrix of drawings, pick two sliders for your element, vary one along the row and the other along the columns.

* there will be a pinup friday at 8pm for these so you will have time to finish on Friday's session.
